**UPDATED**
**you still install it the same way and usage the same way only there is no dropdown menu to select process as you now have to fetch the process ID**
**1 extract the .zip file**
**2 open the extracted file**
**3 run the .exe as admin to avoid any permission errors**
# how to use
**open the game/app u want to inject into**
**fetch the process ID of the game/app u want to inject to get the process ID of the game/app open taskmanager go to details locate the game/app and look at its PID then enter it in the DLL injector and inject**
 **load your .DLL**
**press inject**
**this will come with a test DLL that prints ("hello")**

**add the folder to exclusions if it gets false flagged this is caused by antivirus flagging it as malicious because it modifies the game files**
**how a DLL injector works is injecting a .DLL file (basically a addon file that will modify the game)**
**if u want to get some good cheat DLL's**
**https://www.unknowncheats.me/ would be my recommendation**
**if you dont trust the pre compiled exe you can build it from the source file**
# how to build
**install visual studio 2022(preferred/easiest)**
**1 download the source file**
**2 extract and open the source file(zip) locate the .sln file and double click it automatically open visual studio with that file open**
**3 at the top select build and build solution**
**4 open the extracted folder again and locate the FDJ.exe note:(this can be anywhere so check all the folders im not sure which one)**
**5 run the exe**
