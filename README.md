#how to install
extract the .zip file
ignore the _internals folder
this was converted using autopytoexe meaning the _internals folder is generated by autopytoexe and is needed for the .exe to work
add the folder to exclusions if it gets false flagged this is caused by antivirus flagging it as malicious because it modifies the game files
how a DLL injector works is injecting a .DLL file (basically a addon file that will modify the game)
if u want to get some good cheat DLL's
https://www.unknowncheats.me/ would be my recommendation
