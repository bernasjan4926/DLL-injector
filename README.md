# how to install
**1 extract the .zip file**
**2 open the extracted file**
**3 run the .exe as admin to avoid any conflicts**
# how to use
**open the game u want to load the .DLL into or the process you want to inject into**
**open the dropdown menu select the game process**
 **load your .DLL**
**press activate**
**press inject**
**this will come with a test DLL that prints ("hello")**



# ignore the _internals folder
**this was converted using autopytoexe meaning the _internals folder is generated by autopytoexe and is needed for the .exe to work**
**add the folder to exclusions if it gets false flagged this is caused by antivirus flagging it as malicious because it modifies the game files**
***how a DLL injector works is injecting a .DLL file (basically a addon file that will modify the game)**
**if u want to get some good cheat DLL's**
